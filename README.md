# TVSeriesList
Create a list with your favorite TV series and share them with your friends.

## Project 
This app start as a personal project made to learn and get some experience with Node.js and React. I have been learning and trying to become a JavaScript developer and I got tired of making small apps like the classic calculator/minigame that in reality nobody is going to use, and instead I want to make a real application that is useful and hopefully with a lot of users.

I plan the first version of this app to be very simple and concise with a few important features:
- Users can signup and login.
- Users can fill up his profile with Picture, Name, Age, etc.
- Users can add already watched TV Series and give them a score. This will make their own personal 'TV Series List".
- Users can see images, description and all the data fron those shows. This data will be loaded from a external API.
- Users can make a "I want to watch" list.
- Users will have a personal link to his 'TV Series List' and sharing this link will make any of his friend to see his favorite series and the score the gave.

After that I have in mind a lot other features, specially focusing on tracking and social features. Also a mobile app probably using react native.

Inspired on https://myanimelist.net/ and http://goodreads.com/.
