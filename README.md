# tvserieslist
Create a list with your favorite TV series and share them with your friends.

## Project 
This is a personal project to practice and learn to create Nodejs APIs and React Apps. I have been learning and trying to become a Developer and I got tired
of creating small apps like the classic calculator/minigame, and instead I want to make a real application that is useful and hopefully with a lot of users.

I want the first version of TVSeriesList to be very simple and concise with a few important features:
- Users can signup and login.
- After they signup, they will see a big button to start adding already watched TV Shows and give the a score. This is the 'TV Series List".
- They can fill up his profile with Picture, Name, Age, etc.
- They will see images, description and another data fron those shows. This data will be loaded from a external API.
- The will be able to create a "I want to watch" list.
- They will have a link that can share with other people and they will be able to see those lists.

After that I have in mind a lot other features, specially focusing on adding more tracking options for your tv series and more social features. Also creating a mobile app probably using react native.

Inspired on https://myanimelist.net/ and http://goodreads.com/.
